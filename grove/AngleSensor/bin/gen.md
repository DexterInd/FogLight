# Starting a FogLighter project using Maven: 
[Instructions here.](https://github.com/oci-pronghorn/FogLighter/blob/master/README.md)
 
# Example project:
 
The following sketch demonstrates a simple application to control two LEDs using an Angle Sensor.

Demo code (copy and paste this to a FogLighter project):
.include "./src/main/java/com/ociweb/grove/IoTApp.java"

When executed, turning the knob will cause LED2 to turn on/off and LED1 to fade in/out accordingly.
